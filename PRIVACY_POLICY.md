## Introduction
"Insight" is a non-profit initiative by Turing, the Computer Club of IISER Mohali. It aims to provide a common platform for students to access various services and information relevant to their college experience. The app includes features such as a lost and found system, hostel complaints system, event calendar, campus map, mess menu, important contacts, and club/student body pages. This privacy policy outlines how "Insight" collects, uses, and protects user information.

## Types of Information Collected
  1. Personal Information: When a user chooses to log in using their IISER Mohali email ID, the app mandatorily collects their name and registration number (obtained from the Institute email).

  2. Non-Personal Information: The app may collect non-personal information, including usage patterns and interactions with the app's features as a part of the Analytics service.

  3. Third-Party Services: "Insight" uses Google-provided APIs to facilitate student authentication and login. Google's privacy practices apply to the information shared during this process.

## Collection Methods
The app collects information through user input during registration and login. Additionally, non-personal information is collected through user interactions with the app's features by means of Google Analytics.
